This project is a part of a capstone course about vulnerability to extreme heat. 
Our work included working in conjunction with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) to help update Dane Countyâ€™s Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI), 
a metric aimed to represent specific areas' vulnerability level to extreme heat events. 
Included in the metric are a wide variety of  factors, including demographic factors such as race, age, and gender, health factors such as number of heat related hospitalizations, 
and environmental factors such as percentage of impervious surface.
